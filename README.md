## ðŸ‘‹ About Me
Hi, I'm Jaebeom Kim, an undergraduate student passionate about discovering and solving real-world problems through data.

I enjoy exploring diverse types of data â€” from time series and images to natural language â€” to uncover patterns and build solutions.  
I am highly motivated by the challenge of translating complex, real-world problems into data-driven models, and I strive to grow continuously as both a developer and a researcher.
