## ðŸ‘‹ About Me
Hi, I'm Jaebeom Kim, an undergraduate student in Industrial Engineering with a joint major in Artificial Intelligence.
I am passionate about understanding complex systems and designing data- and optimization-driven solutions that create real-world impact.

My academic and project experiences span from modeling and analyzing dynamic systems to developing algorithms for decision-making under uncertainty. I am motivated by the challenge of bridging theory and practiceâ€”transforming ideas into solutions that are not only technically sound but also practically valuable.
